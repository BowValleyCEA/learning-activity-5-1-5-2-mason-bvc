# Game1401 Learning Activities for Week 5
### Activity 5.1: Recording a High Score

You are playing a game of Pac-Man and each time you play the game, if you score high enough, your score will end up in the list of high scores. Create a High Score class and allow people to record their initials with a high score. Display this if someone chooses to see a high score, and exit the program if they choose to do that.

### Activity 5.2: Be Kind; Please Rewind.

The year is 2002. You are at a clerk at your local BrickBuster. The customer bases is unruly, and they are sick to death of playing late fees. You are to create a new POS system that will allow them to check out videos *indefinitely*, even if this may lead to the eventual closing of the business.

Your system must take user accounts into consideration. These will keep track of:

1. Their name
2. Their user ID (generated by your program)
3. What videos they currently have checked out
4. What videos they have checked out in the past.

Your POS system needs to allow for people to rent videos. Therefore, it must have a list of videos. It also must keep track of whether a video is rented or not, how long it has been rented for, and by whom. Your POS system needs to allow people to return videos, rent videos, and search to see if a particular video, or list of videos, exists.

Each video must contain the following information:

1. Its name
2. Its ID (generated by your program)
3. Its genre
4. The duration of the movie.
